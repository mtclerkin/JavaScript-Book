/*
Exercise 2: 

In the exercises for the previous chapter, you wrote a dynamic greeter 
program named greeter.js. Add a function to this program that solicits 
the user's first and last names in separate invocations (Input_Output Exercise 3); 
the function should return the appropriate name as a string. 
Use the return values to greet the user with their full name.
